# Jetpack Compose Basics

This repository documents my learning journey through the basics of Jetpack Compose, following the [Jetpack Compose Basics Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-basics).

## Topics Covered

1. **Starting a New Compose Project**  
   Learned how to set up a new project with Jetpack Compose, including initial setup and project configuration to start using Compose.

2. **Getting Started with Compose**  
   Gained an understanding of the basics of Compose, such as using `@Composable` functions to declare dynamic and reactive UI elements.

3. **Tweaking the UI**  
   Customized the UI using various Compose functions and parameters to achieve the desired design.

4. **Reusing Composables**  
   Practiced creating reusable components by defining `@Composable` functions that can be used throughout the app.

5. **Creating Columns and Rows**  
   Built layouts with `Column` and `Row` to arrange UI components vertically and horizontally.

6. **State in Compose**  
   Managed state within Compose, learning how data can reactively influence the UI.

7. **State Hoisting**  
   Separated state management from UI components, promoting modularity and reducing code duplication.

8. **Creating a Performant Lazy List**  
   Created an efficient list with `LazyColumn` and `LazyRow`, rendering only visible items to optimize performance.

9. **Persisting State**  
   Maintained state across UI recreations, using `rememberSaveable` to retain state data.

10. **Animating List**  
    Applied animations to lists, creating smooth and interactive transitions.

11. **Styling and Theming**  
    Explored styling and theming to maintain consistent app design, including colors, shapes, and text according to the app's theme.

## Conclusion

Jetpack Compose offers a modern, declarative way to build UI on Android. With Compose, UI can be managed more easily, dynamically updated, and aligned with a compositional approach, simplifying state management, animation, and theming. After mastering these basics, I now have a solid foundation for developing more advanced Android app UIs with Jetpack Compose.
